The bundle service oriented communication (SOCom) implements components for client/server pattern based communication for the following communication paradigms:

* remote procedure call;
* publish/subscribe (event communication).

SOCom provides interfaces which enable the implementation of service gateways (bridges).
This allows users to independently implement service bridges for different communication protocols (e.g. IPC, SOME/IP, …).
SOCom provides intra-process client/server communication only.
